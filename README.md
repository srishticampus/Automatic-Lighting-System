# Automatic-Lighting-System

This project automatically turns a light ON or OFF depending on how bright it is around.

It uses an LDR (Light Sensor) to check the amount of sunlight.

When it gets dark, the system turns the light ON (through a relay).

When itâ€™s bright, it turns the light OFF to save electricity.
